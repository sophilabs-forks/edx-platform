<p class="p2"><span class="s1">21.</span> <span class="s3">Geographic Scope</span><span class="s1">.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">22.</span> <span class="s3">Governing Law; Exclusive Forum</span><span class="s1">. These Terms of Use, and the relationship between you and NodeRabbit resulting from your use or attempted use of the Services or Software, and the resolution of any dispute arising out of that relationship, shall all be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to any conflict of law principles or provisions. You agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related in any manner to these Terms of Use, or the relationship between you and NodeRabbit resulting from these Terms of Use or your use or attempted use of the Services or Software, shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located within Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">24.</span> <span class="s3">Miscellaneous</span><span class="s1">. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then such invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement will continue in effect. If any provision(s) is found to be contrary to law, then such</span> <span class="s1">provision(s) will be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect. NodeRabbit’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless agreed to by NodeRabbit in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of NodeRabbit. NodeRabbit reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use, and related Acceptable Use Policy at any time by providing such revised terms to you. Your continued use of the Software or Services shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by any such revised terms and conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">25.</span> <span class="s3">Entire Agreement</span><span class="s1">. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between NodeRabbit and you with respect to the Software and Services and supersedes all other (prior or contemporaneous) communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or non-electronic, between NodeRabbit and you regarding them. You agree that any terms or conditions contained in any document, including but not limited to a purchase order, acknowledgement, email, or other document that you may now or later provide to NodeRabbit, will have no effect and that this Agreement is the only contract between NodeRabbit and you regarding the Software and Services and may only be amended as set forth herein.</span></p>
